refStarPos: ## positions of the stars in the spatial direction. The first one is the target
- [1055.0,23.0]
refPhotCentering: null ## photometry fits file where to obtain centroid shifts to apply from 1 star/source
copyCentroidFile: null ## photometry or centroid fits file where to obtain centroids to avoid re-calculating
srcGeometry: Circular ## Source aperture geometry, Circular or Rectangular
bkgSub: True ## Do background subtraction?
bkgGeometry: CircularAnnulus ## Background geometry, Circular Annulus or Rectangular
bkgMethod: colrow #colrow ## Method for background estimate (mean, median, robust mean)
apRadius: 3 #Source aperture radius
apHeight: null ## Source aperture height (only for rectangular aperture)
apWidth: null ## Source aperture width (only for rectangular aperture)
#nanTreatment: 'zero' ## How to treat NaNs in image? 'zero' will set to 0. 'value' will set to nanReplaceValue
backStart: 4 #ckground annulus start radius
backEnd: 5 #ackground annulus end radius
backHeight: null ## background aperture height (for rectangular background)
backWidth: null ## background aperture width (only for rectangular aperture)
backOffset: [0.,0.] ## Background offset (from source centroid)
boxFindSize: 5 ## the half-width of the box used for source centroiding
jdRef: 2457551 ## JD reference offset to subtract
timingMethod: JWSTint ## how to assign integration times? None, 'JWSTint' will add int time
scaleAperture: False ## Scale the aperture with the FWHM?
apScale: 2.5 ## number of times the FWHM for aperture-scaling
apRange: [2,17] ## min/max range of allowed FHWM, when scaling
isCube: False ## Is the data a cube (3D)?

doCentering: True #Center the aperturess with Gaussian?
FITSextension: 0 ## FITS extension of science frames
HEADextension: 0 ## FITS extension of the header info (for exposure and timing)
isSlope: True ## Is the FITS image a slope image that should be multiplied by the int time?
subpixelMethod: exact ## Method for subpixel positions in aperture photometry. "exact" will calculate exactly while "center" will use whole pixels (faster to run)

backsub_directions: ['X'] ## directions and order in which to do polynomial colrow subtraction
saturationVal: null ## put in a value so that if the source aperture has more than satNPix points, it's counted as NaN. If None, ignored.
satNPix: 5 ## number of pixels above saturation to declare as Nan
nanReplaceValue: 22e3 ## replacement value for NaNs if nanTreatment is set at "value"
